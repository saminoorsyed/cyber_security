### DCMA exceptions
	- fair use
	- reverse engineering
	- encryption research
	- security testing
	- personal privacy
- there are concerns that DMCA inhibit lefit software security and encryption research
	- innovation and academic freedom is stifled when OSS is threatened

### Tension b/w Privacy and security
- understanding expectations of privacy

- in 1996 US govt offered to reduce export restrictions for escrow encryption

- US did not fully explain encryption algos

### COmpliance pressure on industry

- THree major regulations:
	- Sarbanes-Oakley act (SOA, or SOX)

	- payment and remittance advice
	- claim stats/ inquiry response

	- referral authorization inquiry/response
- Secretary of Health and Human services in charge
- drove many tech changes in teh health sector

### Professional codes of conduct
