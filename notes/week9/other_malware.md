# Other Malware

## Zero Day Expoit

- Any computer eploit where there is no patch available
- time between exploit discovery and wide activation shrinking
- Malware developer has a tradoff
	- bigh splash, but fast discovey
	- slow attack, later discovery
## Trojan horses
- seemingly useful programs that contain code that does harm
	-perform over and covert actions
- frequently embedded in applets or games, email attachments
- Trojan horse logins, spoof authentication or webpage forms

## Root Kits:
- sophisticated cloaking malware that can hide itself
- more popular now
- new versions perform extra checks to hide info before perrforming original call
	- can replace function table entries:
	- can replace windows API pointers (user mode)
	- can replace syscall table pointers
- both require priveledge, but most windows installs require priv anyways
- Applys to Linux and mac as well

### Rootkit infultration:

- system call table has entries that are pointers to actual functions
- after a root kit is installed, pointers might point elswhere
- could replace entire syscall table with a differen t table
- could replace code that pointer is pointed at

### countermeasure

- hard to defend/ detect
- user Mode - look for discrepancy
	- between results of dif apis
	- between api results and direct access to storage
	- root kit revealer tools
- Sony Player DRM and root kits
	- to ensure that copy protection is not evaded, installed rootkit to hide protected code
	- available for other attackers
	- not un-installable
	- uses CPU and memory
	- not adequatedly noted by EULA
	- lots of bad press in 2005

### VM Root kits
- Blue pill rootkit
	- changes the boot process to install another hypervisor layer
	- original hypervisor is not awaree of extra layer
- need to secure boot process

## Ransom ware
- latest malware causeing anxiety
- any malicious software that is designed to deny access to sys or data until ransom is paid
- typically decrypts file system and holds the key until ransom is paid
- exploits vuln in a system an lures users often times through phishing attacs to install

###Defense
- Good data back ups
- keep system up to date
- safe browsing habits
