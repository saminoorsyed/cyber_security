One aspect of cybersecurity that's been on my lately is the way we might model the kinds of adversaries out there in the world. This field has an entire armamentarium of tools and methods we can use to protect our data. These tools are divided and subdivided into categories based on their use-cases, efficacy, efficiency, and so on. Having a detailed mental model of the tools at ones disposal helps when selecting the most suitable one for the task at hand. 

It might be also helpful to think about how we might differentiate our adversaries. It doesn't make much sense to lump all adverseries together in a single bucket. After all, the sophistication and resources of one might entirely eclipse those of another. For instance, would it change your approach if your adversary was a single garden-variety identity thief rather than an entire criminal syndicate employing a small army of sophisticated personnel? Of course, one thing about adversaries is that they don't tend to announce themselves, but maybe it's worth thinking about. Effectively defending against the former might cost you much less than defending against the latter, but if you defend against the latter you get the former "for free", so to speak. But you also don't want to waste resources against those who aren't a threat to you.

Taking things a step further, what might you do if the government of a large and wealthy sovereign nation has it out for you? What steps can you take to defend yourself? It may be difficult to defend against an adversary with truly vast resources, possibly to the point where attempting to do would be a fruitless waste of your own, presumably much more limited, resources. Just something I've been thinking about a bit lately!
