Since I was a kid things like Caesar’s cipher and secret messages struck me as fun. I still remember when my best friend from 1st grade and I got walkie talkies and learned morse code. It was fun, but it took a lot of time to be able to listen to a message and write it out. I chose to study Cyber security this quarter not just because it seemed fun, but also because I wanted to learn something that I could not learn as easily elsewhere. I think there are also a lot of practical applications for using cyber security as well. For instance if I want to store my passwords, api keys or secrets on github as a backup, I can put them all into a file and encrypt them with aes-128-cfb. Now as long as I remember my pass code, I can access all of that important info without having my personal laptop available. Also, When I’m eventually building sites and products, It’ll be very helpful to have a solid grasp of the concepts behind the cryptographic tools I’m using rather than just what’s in the how-to guides I find. I think I’ll get to learning a lot of useful and interesting topics through this class. In fact, I already have.
