What I particularly find intriguing about cybersecurity is the mathematic basis for the discipline. I really enjoy proofs and learning mathematical concepts, so the math behind ideas like collisions in hashing algorithms is a lot of fun for me. I like to connect all of the dots in things I have learned in multiple classes, and seeing it all come together feels great. Additionally, I like the feeling of competition between the security engineer and the adversary.
